# 👋 Hi!
I'm Emby01, you can call me Emby. I made this GitHub account originally just to connect it to Discord lol. But now I actually use it for programming-related and software development!

~~Proudly~~ part of [ErroneousCreations](https://github.com/ErroneousCreations), the definitely best indie game dev team
# 👀 What I do
I use this GitHub account for many things:
- Helping develop [ErroneousCreationist](https://github.com/ErroneousCreationist)'s game, Ugmania (go check it out at https://erroneouscreationist.itch.io/ugmania)
- Also helping [ErroneousCreationist](https://github.com/ErroneousCreationist) create the Wrian the Gamer mod for Don't Starve Together
- Something to connect to my Discord account
- And maybe software development in the future.
# 🌱 What I’m currently learning
I'm overall just trying to get the hang of creating things with GitHub. Also trying to figure out how to get better at programming. And so trying to use Unity.
# 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: 
Nothing. interesting choice of emoji for the template github
# 📫 How to reach me ...
idk actually
