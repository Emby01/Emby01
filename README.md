# 👀 What I do
I use this GitHub account for many things:

- helping create the [Wrian the Gamer mod for Don't Starve Together](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2837791923)
- something to connect to my Discord account (the more connections the cooler)
- and maybe software development in the future.
- or maybe software development now.
- game development (kind of)
- figuring out how to use pull request

# 🌱 What I’m currently learning
I'm overall just trying to get the hang of creating things with GitHub. also trying to figure out how to get better at programming. and ~~also trying to use Unity (and following Brackeys tutorials bc im dum)~~ (now godot, because unity stuff).
# 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: 
Nothing. interesting choice of emoji for the template github. collaboration is fun, but i first have to figure out how to use a pull request properly. keep that in mind.
